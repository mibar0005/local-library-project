# Local Library Project


You have decided to put together a local library where people can lend and borrow books. 
One of the most important features needed to organize this is a dashboard that will show which books are available,
which are currently out, and other general statistics about the program.

Technologies to be used in this program: 

    -Using Visual Studio Code as a text editor
    -Differentiating between the three most common JavaScript error types
    -Solving bugs by using error messages
    -Differentiating between let, const, and var, and using each appropriately
    -Creating an array from a string based on particular criteria and joining arrays into strings
    -Writing strings that embed expressions using template literals
    -Accessing all the values and keys of an object
    -Using find(), filter(), map(), some(), and every() to solve different problems
    -Using reduce() to solve different problems
    -Using sort() to sort arrays in various ways
